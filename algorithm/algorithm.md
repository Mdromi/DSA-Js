# Algorithm

__What is an Algorithm?__

An Algorithm is a set of well-defined instruction of solve a particular problem

__Why Algorithms?__

As a developer, you are going to come across problem that you need to solve.

Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.

One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

Every algorithm comes with it own tradeoffs when its comes of performance

__Time complexity -__ Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

__Space complexity -__ Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
